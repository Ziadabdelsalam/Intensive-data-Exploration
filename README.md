# Intensive-data-Exploration

# Throughout this project we put in practice many of the strategies . We got to know the variables, we analysed 'SalePrice' alone and with the most correlated variables, we dealt with missing data and outliers, we tested some of the fundamental statistical assumptions and we even transformed categorial variables into dummy variables.
